# Description
This watchface is inspiried by the Professor Layton series, but more specifically Professor Layton's London Life. I made it since I am a big fan of the franchise and as a Pebble user, I thought a watchface was lacking. You can choose from 30 characters to appear on the watchface. In addition, there is also a random option that will shuffle through characters based on the time of day and on load. 

If you wish to install this watchface, please do so through the Rebble App Store link above.

The Pebble documentation is all over the place since they shut down, so feel free to use code from this repo to help you in your own projects. You're free to reference and use this code, but please don't take the whole project and upload it as your own.

Enjoy!
